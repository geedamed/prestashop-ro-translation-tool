prestashopDiacriticsConverter
=============================

PHP script to convert the the ăâîșțĂÂÎȘȚ diacritics to plain aaistAAIST in Prestashop's Romanian translations


USAGE

Copy romanian_diacritics_converter.php in your Prestashop root directory, then run it.

Right now it saves the old translations in /translations/export/ro_diacritics_yymmdd-hhmmss/. The old translations can be then restored by copying them over the prestashop root directory.


WARNING

It was only tested on my local machine. Make backups and be safe. Ultimately, if anything goes wrong, it is your site and your responsability - I'll try to help, but I'll not accept any responsability.
