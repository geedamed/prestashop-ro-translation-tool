prestashopDiacriticsConverter
=============================

PHP script to convert the the ăâîșțĂÂÎȘȚ diacritics to plain aaistAAIST in Prestashop's Romanian translations

Right now it saves the old translations in /translations/export/ro_diacritics_yymmdd-hhmmss/. The old translations can be then restored by copying them over the prestashop root directory.

WARNING: It was only tested on my local machine. Make backups and be safe. If anything goes wrong, I'll try to help. But ultimately it is your site and your responsability. I'll not accept any responsability if anything goes wrong.
